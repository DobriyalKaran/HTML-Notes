## 1. HTML Document Structure

Every HTML page follows a **hierarchy** — like a family tree.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>   → Defines HTML version (HTML5 here).
<html>            → Root of the page
  <head>          → Metadata (info *about* the page, not visible directly)
  <body>          → Actual content (what user sees)
</html>
```

👉 Think of it as:

- **Head** = “Backstage” (title, SEO, CSS, JS).
- **Body** = “Stage” (the visible performance).

If you miss proper structure, your page may still run, but it will **break in SEO, 
accessibility, or future scaling**.

## 🔹 2. Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)

Headings give **hierarchy to content**.

- `<h1>` = Most important heading.
- `<h6>` = Least important heading.

👉 Rules & Best Practices:

- Use only **one `<h1>` per page** → It defines the main topic.
- Sub-sections should use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. (like chapters and subchapters).
- Don’t use headings for styling (use CSS for size). Use them **only for meaning**.

👉 Real-life analogy:

Think of a **book**:

- Title → `<h1>`
- Chapter name → `<h2>`
- Section → `<h3>`
- Subsection → `<h4>`

This structure makes content **SEO-friendly** and easier for screen readers.

## 🔹 3. Paragraphs (`<p>`)

- A `<p>` defines a **block of text**.
- Browsers automatically add **margin (spacing)** before and after paragraphs.
- You should never replace `<p>` with `<br>` (line break) for spacing.

👉 Why important?

Because `<p>` is semantic → search engines and accessibility tools understand it 
as **paragraphs of meaning**, not just random text.

## 🔹 4. Text Formatting Tags

HTML provides **inline tags** to style or add meaning to text.

### Common Formatting Tags:

- `<b>` → Bold (just makes text thick, no meaning).
- `<strong>` → Important (semantic emphasis, better for SEO).
- `<i>` → Italic (slanted text, visual only).
- `<em>` → Emphasis (semantic, conveys stress/importance).
- `<u>` → Underline.
- `<mark>` → Highlighted text (yellow by default).
- `<small>` → Smaller text.
- `<sup>` → Superscript (e.g., X²).
- `<sub>` → Subscript (e.g., H₂O).
- `<del>` → Deleted/strikethrough text.
- `<ins>` → Inserted/added text (often underlined).

👉 Golden Rule:

Use **semantic tags** (`<strong>`, `<em>`) over presentational ones (`<b>`, `<i>`).

Because **semantic tags carry meaning**, which helps SEO and accessibility.

## 🔹 5. Real-Life Example of Proper Use

Imagine you’re writing a **news article** on a website:

- Title of news → `<h1>`
- Subtitle (category: “Sports”) → `<h2>`
- Article text → `<p>`
- Important quote → `<strong>`
- Date published → `<small>`
- Player’s chemical formula for sports drink → H<sub>2</sub>O

👉 This makes content not only look good but also **organized and meaningful** to Google, 
screen readers, and users.

## 🔹 6. Common Mistakes Beginners Make

❌ Using `<br>` everywhere instead of `<p>`.

❌ Using `<h1>` multiple times just for bigger fonts.

❌ Using `<b>` everywhere instead of `<strong>`.

❌ Using headings for styling instead of structure.

👉 Fix: **Always use tags for their purpose, not for looks.** Use CSS for styling.

---

✅ **Summary (Quick Recall)**

- **Structure**: `<head>` (meta info), `<body>` (visible content).
- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>`, one `<h1>` only.
- **Paragraphs**: `<p>` = blocks of text.
- **Text Formatting**: Use semantic tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`) for meaning, not just looks.
